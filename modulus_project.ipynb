    "`find_sources` returns a list of incides of the \"sources\" of the sequence. For MISS, these are the indices `i` of `s` such that every element of index less than `i` has value greater than `s[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call `recursive_function(pi)` calls the outside wrapper for `recurse` with `s` as the given sequence $\\pi$. \\\n",
    "This initializes the return usage matrix m as an empty numpy matrix. Then, for every source index in the source list, `recurse` is called. `recurse` can be thought of as a form of depth first search. With the previous example, the sources are at indices 0 and 1. These are the base \"branches.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with 0, `recurse` is called with `s`, 0, and [0 0 0 0 0]. Recurse sets `s[0]` to 1 so the `row` is now [1 0 0 0 0]. Now initialize `greater` as an empty list. for every element from the current index to the end of the sequence, we check them in order with the statement `if s[i] > s[x] and all(s[j] > s[i] for j in greater)`. In essence, this statement checks if all elements already added to the `greater` list are greater than the current element. If so, the index of this element can be added to `greater`. This is because if there is an element in `greater` that is less than the current element, the connection from `s[x]` to the current element will *not* be part of a MISS becuase it can be easily be extended by going through an element in `greater`. Continuing from the example, `greater` starts as [], then [2], then [2, 4]. Then we check if `greater` is empty. In this case, it is not. Finally, we call `recurse` on every element in `greater` with the given row [1 0 0 0 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "Now going through futher calls in the recursion, `recurse(s, 0, [0 0 0 0 0])` calls `recurse(s, 2, [1 0 0 0 0])` calls `recurse(s, 3, [1 0 1 0 0])`. Here, the row is set as [1 0 1 1 0] and greater is []. Thus, this row is then concatenated on the matrix. `m` is now [1 0 1 1 0] and we return. This returns again as we are out of elements in `greater`. Back to the first recursive call, we still have index 4 to go through. This results in row [1 0 0 0 1] being appended to m. We then go through the next source, index 1, recursing and concatenating as described before, until the entire matrix `m` is generated and we return `m` from the recursive wrapper function.\n"
